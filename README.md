# MicroconGeniusGame
Here you can find two forms of the genius game for a PIC microcontrollers: one is for a `LCD display`, the other is for a `7-segments display`.  
__Language__: C.  
__Platform__: Microcon.

These codes were made for a class called "Microcontrollers" that I had in the Computer Science graduation (2016, first semester).  
It was really fun to do.  
The board we used was __ACEPIC PRO__ (https://www.acepic.com.br/).

Have fun :)
